# open-source-havamal

Hello all,

This is a simple repository of existing Havamal translations in JSON format, including the raw icelandic text.

This repository also includes a very rough machine translated version using Google Translate. Use at your own discretion. Translation quality is not guaranteed with that translation.

Also included is a JSON format version of Edward Petit's translation, released under Creative Commons licensing terms.
