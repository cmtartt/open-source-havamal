seventeenth I know, so that seldom shall go\nA maiden young from me;\n"},{"text":"Long these songs you shall, Loddfafnir,\nSeek in vain to sing;\nYet good it were if you might get them,\nWell, if you would them learn,\nHelp, if you had them.\n"},{"text":"An eighteenth I know, that never will I tell\nTo maiden or wife of man,â€“\nThe best is what none but one's self doth know,\nSo comes the end of the songs,â€“\nSave only to her in whose arms I lie,\nOr who else my sister is.\n\n"}]}
